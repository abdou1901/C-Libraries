## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of C libraries designed to provide reusable functions for common programming tasks. Each library focuses on a specific domain (numbers, strings, arrays, matrices, and ciphers) and includes comprehensive testing files, implementation files, and header files. Additionally, full documentation is provided to help users understand and utilize these libraries effectively.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository aims to simplify coding by offering modular, well-documented, and tested functions.

## Features
- **Modular Design**: Each library is self-contained with its own .c, .h, and test files.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Every function in the libraries has been rigorously tested using interactive test files.
- **Full Documentation**: A single consolidated documentation file explains all functions across all libraries.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new functions or libraries as needed.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Written in standard C, ensuring compatibility across platforms.

## How to Use
### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdou1901/C-Libraries.git
cd C-Libraries
```
### Compile and Run Tests:
Navigate to the desired library folder and compile the test file (main.c) with the corresponding .c file:
```bash
gcc -o test_numbers main.c num.c
./test_numbers
```
Repeat this process for other libraries.

### Include Libraries in Your Projects:
To use any library in your projects, include the respective .h file and link the .c file during compilation:
```bash
gcc -o my_program my_program.c num.c -I./numbers
```

## Documentation
A detailed documentation file (`docs/documentation.md`) is included in the `docs` folder. It provides explanations, examples, and usage instructions for every function across all libraries.
