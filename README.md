**Introduction
This repository contains a collection of C libraries designed to provide reusable functions for common programming tasks. Each library focuses on a specific domain (numbers, strings, arrays, matrices, and ciphers) and includes comprehensive testing files, implementation files, and header files. Additionally, full documentation is provided to help users understand and utilize these libraries effectively.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository aims to simplify coding by offering modular, well-documented, and tested functions.

**Features
Modular Design : Each library is self-contained with its own .c, .h, and test files.
Comprehensive Testing : Every function in the libraries has been rigorously tested using interactive test files.
Full Documentation : A single consolidated documentation file explains all functions across all libraries.
Extensible : Easily add new functions or libraries as needed.
Cross-Platform Compatibility : Written in standard C, ensuring compatibility across platforms.


**Repository Structure
The repository is organized into five main folders, one for each library:

Libraries Overview
Numbers Library
The Numbers Library provides functions for numerical operations such as arithmetic, factorials, prime checks, and more.


**How to Use
Clone the Repository :
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/C-Libraries.git
        cd C-Libraries
Compile and Run Tests :
Navigate to the desired library folder and compile the test file (main.c) with the corresponding .c file:
         gcc -o test_numbers main.c numbers.c
         ./test_numbers
Repeat this process for other libraries.
Include Libraries in Your Projects :
To use any library in your projects, include the respective .h file and link the .c file during compilation:
gcc -o my_program my_program.c numbers.c -I./numbers


**Documentation
A detailed documentation file (docs/documentation.pdf) is included in the docs folder. It provides explanations, examples, and usage instructions for every function across all libraries.
